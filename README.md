# LaTeX Curriculum Vitae Sample
*"aut viam inveniam aut faciam"*

## Purpose
It took me a long time to get my curriculum vitae looking the way I wanted it to.  In the spirit of open source, I wanted to share what worked for me with all the others out there wanting to put their resume together with LaTeX.

## Note
This is not an attempt to solicit a new job.  This resume got me the perfect job, and you couldn't afford what it would take to tempt me away from the great group I work with now.

## To Build
To build ensure LaTeX and scons are installed on your system and execute the following...

`>> scons`

The results of the build can then be read from dist/cv-bellock.pdf
